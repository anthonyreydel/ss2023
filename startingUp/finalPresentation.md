- In today's world of social media, people are more divided than ever before. It’s especially true when we want to participate in some activity or event. It seems easy to message anyone on the phone, but it's actually so hard to find people who want to do the same thing with us. But still, we want to meet people, like-minded people, in real life, and do interesting things together. That, is what we want to help everyone with.

- We want to provide our users an all-in-one platform all about activities. We'll develop tools for every one to organize activitiy for themselves, we'll build a community which helps people reach each other to participate in activities together, we'll provide services to help organizers to reach their audience with efficiency. We'll do all these things, and we'll do them well. We call it Evitivity, Every Activity, Every One, all at once.

- First, I'd like to introduce you to our team. We are a small group of three. First is our Chief Marketing Officer Xiao Chen. Second on the bottom is our Chief Techology Officer Dominik Weis. And last, is me on the upper right, taking the role of Chief Executive Officer.
- Now, let's hear what Dominik, our CTO, wants to tell us about.

---------------------------------

- First let’s take a look at our cost structure. Our cost increase steadily with the development of our business. Staff costs takes the biggest part in our cost structure, which is marked in blue. The stripe marked in orange is our assumption for market expenses, which will increase significantly in 2024, at this point we’ll begin our second marketing campaign and also starting to expand our range of service.

- Then this is our revenue model again. We try to mix our revenue sources as even as possible, advertisement is one of the bigger part in this, in the meantime ticket sales and management software licensing are also our main source of income, wich counterbalance the advertisement part.

- Lastly here is a comparison between our revenue and cost developments. As you can see our business begins to be profitable at around the middle of 2024, at which point we have already entered the market for some time and are preparing to expand our range of services. And thus before this time we’ll need raise funding to cover our development expenses.

- Here you can see our implementation roadmap. First after the idea generation we’ll start developing our prototype and also start hiring. Then we begin testing, market and competitor analysis, develop our market strategy, and finally launch our product after the first MVP is successfully developed, this whole process will take about a year. With this we’ll start our marketing campaign and also raise funding for the first round. With this investment we can cover our upfront costs and maintain our product in the market. In this time period we aim to take a good position in the german market. Once our position is stable, we’ll begin the second round of funding and hiring, which will happen around the beginning of the 3rd year. And this begins our journey to expand to other parts of the europe and also the rest of the world.
