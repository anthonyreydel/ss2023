- What we do?

	- In today's world of social media, people are more divided than ever before. Itâ€™s especially true when we want to participate in some activity or event. It seems easy to message our friends through numerous instant messaging softwares, but it's actually so hard to find people who want to do the same thing with us. But still, we want to meet people, like-minded people, in real life, and do interesting things together. That, is what we want to help everyone with.

- What is the value or benefit it delivers? Why is it important an dexciting?

	- We want to provide our users an all-in-one platform all about activities. We'll develop tools for every one to organize activitiy for themselves, we'll build a community which helps people reach each other to participate in activities together, we'll provide services to help organizers to reach their audience with efficiency. We'll do all these things, and we'll do them well. We call it Evitivity, Every Activity, Every One, all at once.

- What have we done?

	- There hasn't been a platform like us, we know it. And with this comes great responsiblity upon us, we also know it. Our mission, our vision, and our team, will all be shown to you with this presentation. First, I'd like to introduce you to our team.
