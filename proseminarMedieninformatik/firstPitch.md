# First Pitch
- Tracking the real moves: VR and immersive environments
	- Hello everyone, welcome to my presentation. my research title is "Tracking the real moves: VR and immersive environments". This is not the final title, as the literature research is still in working process. But I'm happy to share with you today what I have find.

- Outside and inside a VR-World
	- As the demand of a more immersive experience grow in the VR application field, researchers have been trying to find better ways to track movement data of the user. What I'm interested in is how researchers deal with the relation between virtual and real environment, and also the connection between the collected movement data and these both environments.	

- Which to 'track'?
	- I found from my literature research that researchers take several different ways to deal with the topic I mentioned above. For now I categorize them into three different groups:
	- First Group, some researchers clearly divided the real and virtual environment from each other. They mainly focus on building the needed environment in the VR world, what they need from the real world is a clear and empty field, nothing more.
	- Second Group, these researchers try to build their intended environment in both virtual and real worlds. For them this is necessary to collect the needed data as precise as possible.
	- The third group, these researchers are trying to find a different approach to this problem. They are trying to find a new understanding between the data and environment, so that they can collect and interpret data in a more efficient way. For example, in this research paper the researchers collected location data instead of raw trajectory data to deal with movement data collections in large-scale environments.

- Current Solutions in the research field.
	- This sums up my findings so far. This is in my opinion an interesting topic, although it's still raw and not refined. In the following steps I'll try to refine it into a more specific thought. Thank you for your listening.
